## Objectives

When building a wether dashboard application using API's from other developers I would like to meet the following criteria - 

* WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
